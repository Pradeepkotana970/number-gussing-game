# number-gussing-game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python console application where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the game provides feedbackâ€”telling the player whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.
